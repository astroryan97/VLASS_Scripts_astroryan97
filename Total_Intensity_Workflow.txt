#Ensure to check the pipeline outputs after each run to ensure reliability of your results. 
#Additionally, if you forsee utilizing a significant number of VLASS measurment sets (>10) notify the archive team via help desk ticket such that they 
#remove the full measurement sets when you are done transfering them to your NRAO lustre area. 


1) Identify the required measurement set(s) utilizing the Tile_Boundaries.csv and VLASS_Tile_Puller.py
2) Request the calibrated measurement set(s) from data.nrao.edu and download to a working directory on the NRAO cluster
3) Open casa and run the carlson_editimlist_prep.py script, with your respective phase center and image size. Save the output string.
4) Use the output string from carlson_editimlist_prep.py and use the split command to generate a sub measurement set with the required fields.
5) Move this sub-MS to a new working directory with the run_SE.sh, command_script.py and SEIP_parameters.list files located in this repo. 
6) Change the run_SE.sh, command_script.py and SEIP_parameters.list with the appropriate imaging parameters, file locations and resource allocations
7) When calculating image size, to avoid aliasing, your image size will be your desired image size plus 1000 arcseconds divided by your desired cell size (typically
0.6 arcseconds for SE images)
8) If utilizing multiple cores for imaging you must use mpicasa for the pipeline to parallelize tclean 
9) Once all files have been modify, you can submit a slurm job via the run_SE.sh/run_SE_slurm.sh scripts.
